# How to Get the Required Values to Set Up Trello Integration

## Getting the **trelloBoardId**

In your Trello board's URL, you'll see something like: `https://trello.com/b/xeVjRZvE/my-board`, the board ID is `xeVjRZvE`.

## How to Get Your **apiKey** and **token**

To get these two, go to [get API key](https://trello.com/app-key).

There, you'll need to create a new **workspace** for your app.

Once you have the API key, click the **"token"** link on the same page to generate your token.

## How to Get the **trelloListId**

With your **token** and **API key**, simply paste the following URL into your browser. This will return the lists from your board. Choose the one where issues will be created and copy its ID.

> **URL: `https://api.trello.com/1/boards/BOARD_ID/lists?key=API_KEY&token=TOKEN`**

---

And thatâ€™s it! Once an error occurs, an issue will automatically be created in the selected list.
